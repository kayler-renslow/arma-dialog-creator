### This project is no longer being maintained. I will not respond to your bugs/issues. Sorry.

### About
Arma Dialog Creator is a tool for creating dialogs for Arma 3. The tool was designed from the beginning to be completely independent from header files (*.h, *.hpp, *.hh), which is how Arma's engine interprets how to create the dialogs. All editing is done with specialized editors such as a color picker and Font chooser.

### Key Features
* Required, optional, and [event handler properties](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/User_Interface_Event_Handlers) listed for all Arma 3 controls.
* Preview window (shows roughly what the dialog would look like in Arma 3)
* Macros so that values don't have to be copied and pasted
* Custom control creation
* SafeZone and Absolute coordinate positioning support ([more info here](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/SafeZone)).
* Preview of Controls that have a .paa image file (must have Arma 3 Tools installed).
* A nice [StringTable](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Stringtable.xml) editor

### Trailer
Here is a trailer for Arma Dialog Creator. It's a really short, but dense, video showing many of the implemented features.
You can watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/0P7pYvGDFvU).

If you would like a slower paced video, check out the preview video below. The preview video is months older than the trailer, but the core of Arma Dialog Creator is pretty much the same.

### Preview Video
Here is a long, slow video showcasing what has been accomplished (as of November 24 2016).
Please note that the video was made in 2016, so a lot has changed and been improved.
